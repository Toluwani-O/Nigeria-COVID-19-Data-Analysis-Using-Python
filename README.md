## Introduction
Welcome to the Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project, "Nigeria COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python." This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data specific to Nigeria and derive valuable insights using Python and data analysis techniques.
## Project Overview
In this capstone project, we perform the following tasks:
* Data collection | Data acquisition of COVID-19 data for Nigeria
  - NCDC Website scraping: This step includes scrapping COVID-19 data from the NCDC website.
  - John Hopkins Data Repository: Obtaining data from the John Hopkins repository.
  - External Data: Save external data to a DataFrame External Data includes but is not limited to: covid_external.csv, Budget data.csv, RealGDP.csv
* Viewing the Data
  - Obtaining basic information about the data using the head() and info() methods.
* Data Cleaning and Preparation
  - Cleaning and preparing the datasets for analysis
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19
  - Exploring data and data analysis
* Visualization of key metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - visualization of data using different charts and summary
* Permoring more analysis
  - Age Analysis
  - Examine the relationship between socioeconomic factors
